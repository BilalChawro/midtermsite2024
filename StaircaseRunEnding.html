At the top of the stairs, you glance around frantically for where to go. It’s pretty dark up here. You can see a light flowing through the door jamb of the room to your left. Might as well go in….**

You ease your way into the room, which is a very large bathroom, with beautiful if somewhat worn down furnishings.**

Suddenly you can hear someone racing up the stairs. “Quick, through here!” You grab Sophie and head for the other doorway in the bathroom.**

The door leads into a very gothic master bedroom. Everything is covered in black and wine colored velvet.**

“Uh, oh…” You have made a wrong turn into hell. Seething at you from the corner is presumably Mrs. Alexander. Her red hair flies out like flames as she jumps and you and Sophie, slashing at you with her knife again and again. You and Sophie are too startled to fight back, and you are cut to ribbons.**

Well, maybe it’s Karma for leaving Vera to die.`;
