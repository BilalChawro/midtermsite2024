Mr. Alexander’s brow furrows into a frown. “Really, I think that’s quite unprofessional, kids. You agreed to help us.”**

Sophie appears to be embarrassed. “No, of course we’re not unprofessional, Mr. Alexander. We’ll do what we came to do. Now could we see the list of tasks?”**

Mr. Alexander’s mood sees to have improved. “Yes, of course. Just come with me upstairs.”**

You’ve got doubts, but Sophie is right on his heels as he heads out of the room. So you shrug and follow as well.**

The three of you head up the stairs. At the top, Mr. Alexander motions for you to go through a door. You and Sophie oblige.**

But as soon as you step across the threshold, Mr. Alexander fiercely slams the door.**

You hear the lock click. “Damn!” you cry out. “What the hell is going on?”**

“I’m sorry!” Sophie whines. “I’m so stupid! I followed him because I was afraid he would give us a bad rep around town! Now I’ve totally screwed us!!”**

You’re not really worried about your reputation right now. As your eyes adjust to the seamy yellow light of your prison, you realize you’re not alone.**

A red-headed woman in a black bathrobe stands menacingly just a few feet away. She holds a large butcher knife, and she starts to approach.**

“Oh my God!” Sophie screams and begins to bang on the door.**

You’ve got to do something fast.`;
