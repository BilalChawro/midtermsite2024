You tumble through a door into a game room of sorts. You exit quickly and find yourself running down a long hallway.**

“Okay, these people are extremely bad news!” Sophie yells as you run.**

The two of you hurdle around the corner of the hallway, only to find yourself face to face with what must be Mrs. Alexander, the lady in the bathrobe!**

She grins at you, her knife gleaming in the pale hall light.**

But you are too pumped up after all you have seen. You and Sophie charge right past her. She manages to swipe at you with the knife, cutting your arm deeply, but you keep running as fast as you can. The two of you can see the staircase, and you tumble down as fast as you can.`;
