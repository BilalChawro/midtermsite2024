You arm yourself with the plunger and prepare to face ….**

The door swings open…**

“Sophie!” you cry.**

The two of you hug each other. “I was so worried about you!” she exclaims.**

“We’ve gotta get out of here,” you tell her. “There’s another body in here, and I think they plan to do the same to us.”**

Sophie grabs your wrist and starts pulling you out of the room, and into a bedroom. As the two of you move, she says, “Yeah, I know. I’ve been looking all over this house for you and I overheard Mr. Alexander talking. Apparently they do some sort of weird rituals to get Mrs. Alexander to have a healthy baby. It has to do with eating organs of teenagers!”**

You shiver as the two of you rush down the hallway.**

Just then, you hear someone on the stairs. You and Sophie rush past the stairs and into a room.`;
