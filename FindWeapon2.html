You and Sophie rush down the mini staircase and look for a place to hide.**

You scurry behind a bookshelf. Sophie squeezes in next to you.**

You hear footsteps, followed by voices. They get louder and come into earshot.**

“I don’t really care, Vera! You find those kids and get them to me!” You wince as you hear Mr. Alexander referring to you and Sophie.**

The reply is too soft for you to hear, but you hear a scuffling noise and Mr. Alexander hisses, “Or, we could just use you…” You hear Vera whimper back something unintelligible.**

The two of them then move away, down the hall. After it has been silent for a few moments, you start to creep out from behind the bookshelf. But as you are feeling your way out, your elbow bumps into a small indentation in the wall. Much to your surprise, the wall opens up into a dark, foul smelling room.**

You stumble back, choking on the smell.**

Just then, you hear a small voice coming out of the darkness. “Helloooo…” it calls.**

What do you do?`;
