Sophie follows warily. “Are you sure she went this way?” she asked you, as you tread softly over oriental rugs, and into a lush and tasteful dining room. “I swear I saw her go…”**

Just then you hush her. “I hear someone in the next room,” you whisper.**

“Why are you whispering?” she whispers back.**

“Gosh, I don’t know. I felt kind of weird creeping through this house. Let’s just go ask whoever’s in there if they can unlock the front door.”**

You push through the swinging door. It’s a kitchen, dressed up with chrome everything. It’s not very well lit, and the only light is the pale rays streaming through curtains near the sink. And standing in front of that sink, facing away from you, is a woman. She has her red hair pulled back in a loose ponytail, and she is wearing a black bath robe.`;
