You grab Sophie's hand and rush through the door to the left. You find yourself in a long, windowed hallway. Making a quick left, the two of you veer back into the Botticelli hallway you saw when you first came in. Sophie pulls you behind the door, and you hear Mr. Alexander rush past, and you see him run to the left, towards the sitting room.**

But you know you are not safe forever. You cautiously edge out from behind the door. You can see the foyer and front door from here. Sophie runs forward optimistically and tries both doors, but no luck, they are still shut tight. You look around the foyer for options. There's the lounge to the right, and the sitting room to the left, but that's where HE went, so it's out. There's also the staircase, looming up into the dark unknown'.**

Hurry! He might come back anytime!`;
