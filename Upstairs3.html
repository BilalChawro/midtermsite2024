“It’s really none of your damn business-” you hear suddenly from the doorway. You whirl around and it is a tall man with dark hair. You recognize his voice as Mr. Alexander, the owner of the house and man who called you for the job.**

“What’s going on here?” Sophie cries. “We were chased up here by some lady with a knife. Look, we just want to leave!”**

“I’m afraid it won’t be that easy,” Mr. Alexander says grimly. “You see, my wife needs something you have. You see these… creatures? These are our failures. My wife and I deserve to have a normal baby, not these horrible freaks. So, my wife just needs to perform a little ritual on you to harvest your young energy.”**

Sophie is cowering next to you. What do you do?`;
