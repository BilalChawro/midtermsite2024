You watch just from around the edge of the wall until you goes through a swinging door into what you briefly glimpse is a kitchen, and then you follow.**

When you push the door into the kitchen, you peek in and see that she is nowhere inside. You and Sophie step cautiously into the kitchen and look around. The kitchen is entirely chrome. The door across the way is still swinging, so you assume she went through there.**

You start to follow her, and then you hear her voice in that direction - talking to Mr. Alexander! He sounds very agitated and is questioning her. They seem to be getting closer, so the two of you duck into the nearest door - a pantry.**

Sophie squirms next to you and whispers in your ear. “There’s something in here!” she hisses. “I feel something on my leg!”**

“Just ignore it,” you whisper back.**

“No!” she cries. You feel her hand whiz past your face in the dark and you know what she is doing - reaching for a light switch.**
