Just as you reach the end, a woman steps out from a doorway. You scream and stop! She has red hair and is wearing a black bathrobe, and she doesn’t look friendly. You guess this from the 10-inch butcher knife she is wielding. Her eyes widen in a maniacal way as she advances. You turn on your heels to run in the opposite direction, but standing right behind you is Mr. Alexander, not looking too friendly himself. He grabs you roughly, pinning your arms behind your back.**

“How long are you going to run around this house?” he asks tensely. You feel a sharp sting, and then a prolonged burn. Not again… “Did you ever really think you could get away? It’s our house after all…” His voice drifts off into the darkness as you sink into unconsciousness.**

But this time you never wake up! No chance to escape this time. Guess you died on the operating table. What a pity.`;
