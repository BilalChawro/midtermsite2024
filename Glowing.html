You’re now in a bathroom, which used to be a really deluxe place, but looks kind of ratty now. You realize the glow is actually coming from the next room.**

Walking as quietly as you can, you creep through the bathroom, gripping the cane tightly. You slowly open the door…..**

This must be the master bedroom. It’s covered from head to toe in black and wine-colored velvet. The Alexanders must be goth, you think.**

You hear a hiss, and turn your head sharply to the right. It’s the woman from the photograph, but she looks pretty crazy now. She’s also got Sophie by the hair with a butcher knife at her throat! Sophie’s eyes are pleading at you.

What do you do?
