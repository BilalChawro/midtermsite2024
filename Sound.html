The shuffling sound stops abruptly. You hear a soft gasp. “Oh, thank goodness!” the voice says. The person moves closer. A soft green light suddenly illuminates the figure of a boy about 13 years old, who is squeezing the indiglo light of his wrist watch. He is short, with wispy black short hair. His face looks dirty and haggard.**

“I’m Silo,” the boy says. “I’ve been in here for 3 days now. I was called here to pet-sit, but I soon learned that was just a trick. Mr. Alexander nearly killed me, but then his wife said something about me being ’unsuitable’, and then he threw me in here.”**

“We’re in a similar situation,” you say, and tell Silo about how you and Sophie came to be where you are.`;
